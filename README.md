# FindJobs REST API

This project is a full-stack Job Finder platform that allows candidates to create detailed profiles and apply for jobs, while recruiters can post job listings and manage applications. It's built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrates cloud-based image uploads via Cloudinary.

The app supports full CRUD operations, authentication (JWT + OAuth), file uploads, and advanced features like searching, filtering, pagination, and role-based access control. Itâ€™s designed with scalability and clean architecture (MVC) in mind, and tested using Vitest to ensure reliability.
